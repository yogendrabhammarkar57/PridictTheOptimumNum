## Deployment

To deploy this project Copy code

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```


### Installing

You can simply download the Python file to get started.

### Usage

To run the program, simply open the command prompt, navigate to the directory where the Python file is located, and type the following command:

Copy code
python optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. (1).ipynb

The program will load the Iris dataset, apply the K-Means clustering algorithm, and visualize the clusters.

### Results
The program will output an elbow curve to help determine the optimal number of clusters. It will then cluster the Iris dataset into three clusters and visualize the clusters on a scatter plot of sepal length and width. The centroids of each cluster will also be displayed on the plot.
